1. **Deutsche Bank all but confirmed that it has Trump's tax returns**. In a statement filed in federal court, the bank did not specifically acknowledge that it has Trump's tax returns in its possession, but it did concede that the House would be able to see the returns of people mentioned in a congressional subpoena issued to the bank if the bank complies with the request. It was not clear whose tax returns the bank has because the names were redacted from the filing, but Deutsche Bank said it has the tax returns of "immediate family" members of those named in the subpoena, which could be handed over to the House if the subpoena is upheld. The House subpoena named Trump, his children, immediate family members, the Trump Organization, trust and other Trump-family-controlled entities, and two other unknown people or entities. Trump is currently suing to prevent Deutsche Bank and other banks from complying with the subpoenas.

2. **Trump announced his full backing for Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro in the struggle to contain the man-made fires currently ripping through the Amazon rainforest**. Bolsonaro is "working very hard on the Amazon fires," Trump tweeted, "and in all respects doing a great job for the people of Brazil - Not easy. He and his country have the full and complete support of the USA!" Bolsonaro played a key role in pushing for the deforestation which directly contributed to the fires. He recently rejected $20 million in international aid to help fight the fires, before deciding on Tuesday to accept all foreign aid from organizations or countries — as long as Brazil can decide how to use the assistance.

3. **Trump instructed his Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to exempt Alaska's 16.7 million-acre Tongass National Forest from logging restrictions put in place nearly two decades ago**. The move would open up more than half of the world's largest intact temperate rainforest to potential logging, energy, and mining projects. It would also undercut a sweeping policy put in place by the Clinton administration known as the "roadless rule," which has remained in place despite decades of legal challenges. Forest Service officials had already planned much more modest changes to managing Tongass, which constitutes the agency’s single largest holding, including a plan finalized in 2016 that would phase out old-growth logging in the Tongass within a decade.

4. **Trump said he would pardon any officials in his administration who break the law in order to help get his border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border completed in time for the 2020 election**. "Don’t worry, I’ll pardon you," Trump reportedly told aides after they expressed concerns about fast-tracking projects by seizing private land through eminent domain, ignoring environmental regulations, and pushing through billion-dollar contracts with construction firms. One administration official said Trump was only joking when he made the comment.
